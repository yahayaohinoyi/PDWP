DOCKER THE SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
-> Docker provides the OS virtualization known as containers
-> The problem docker solves is basically unifying Software development environment making sure all project dependencies and platform are the same.
-> Docker containers shares the kernel and runs on the underlying hardware OS as a process which makes it differnt from a VM
-> Docker considers every line in the dockerfile as an image with the first line as its base
-> When docker builds, each layer is stacked on the next and merged into one single image/layer using the union file system
-> UnionFS allows files from different file system to be overlayed on each other just like they're in a single coherent file system
-> Docker image is the final executable that contains everything needed to run an application. Say blueprint of an application
-> When a docker image runs on the host computer, it spawns a process in its own namespace, this is called a container.
-> When a container runs, changes are applied to the container layer and when the container is stopped, the changes are lost. This is because containers run in a process in memory and when the process stops every space allocated to that process is returned
-> Docker registry is a place where you can store docker images. Mostly Dockerhub. It's that basic.
-> Dockerfile contains a set of instructions required to build an image
-> A typical Dockerfile contains keywords like FROM COPY ADD CMD ENV RUN
-> Difference between RUN and CMD is RUN adds the dependency to the base image while CMD runs a command when the container is up and running.
-> Docker engine is a client-server application that provides the platform, runtime and tooling for building and managing docker images.
-> Docker daemon is a service that runs in the background of the host computer and handles the heavy lifting of most of the Docker commands
-> Docker CLI is the primary way you interact with docker
-> Docker-compose is a tool for defining and running multiple-container application
-> Docker machine is a tool for installing Docker Engines on multiple Vhosts and then managing the hosts
-> docker info
-> docker inspect <IMG> tells us more about an image. The terribly useful parts are the layers that make up the final image, the executables and the command
-> docker rm <CONTAINER> docker rmi <IMG>
-> docker pull <IMG>
-> Docker images have an associated tag. tags typically include names and version labels. Tags make it easy to rollback to previous versions of an image
-> docker run -p 80:80 <IMG> runs an image(builds a container) on port 80 in docker and forwards to 80 on the host machine
(First Stop at Page 31) 

-> docker stop <CONTAINER> stops a running container
-> docker ps shows running containers, docker ps -a shows all

-> Add/copy command copies file from a directory, makes it into an image and runs the container while the VOLUME command just copy volumes to the running container


Guidelines for writing Dockerfiles
-> containers should be ephemeral(stop, destroy and restart)
-> Keep the build context minimal(remove all unneeded files i.e dockerignore)
-> Use multistage builds
-> Skip unwanted packages
-> Minimize the number of layers

(Second stop at 81)

Docker Compose 
-> Docker makes it easy to tie each microservice to a container via docker networks while docker-compose makes orchestration of all of these containers very easy
-> Docker-compose describes the services, networks and volumes required for the application to get started
-> docker-compose up to bring up all containers
-> docker-compose stop stops the container
-> docker-compose started
-> docker-compose logs
-> docker-compose down
-> docker-compose build
-> docker-compose exec <cont> <cmd>   
Docker Compose File Reference
-> Services: These are the first root key of the docker-compose file that needs to be created
-> Build: The build key contains the configuration options that are applied at build time.
-> Image: This tells docker compose what the base image of that service is if builds aren't specified else it uses the image for tag and versioning
-> environment/env_file: As its name suggests, it's used to add environment variables to the app.
-> depends_on -> This is used to set dependency requirements across various services.
-> ports -> The key specifies the port that will be exposed to the port.
-> docker network <CONT>
-> docker inspect <CONT>
-> you could use service name in place of ip address :)
-> docker logs
